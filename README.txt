Building and running
--------------------

To run this you must have ruby, and rubygems installed

On linux, this should be accomplishable with these commands:

  $ sudo apt-get install ruby1.9.1
  $ sudo apt-get install rubygems

On windows, you can install Ruby and Rubygems simultaneously from:
 
  - http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/

On Mac, Leopard and up comes with ruby 1.8.6 and rubygems by default.


Then run the program like:

  $ ./Compile.rb
  $ ./Main.rb

You only need to compile one time. Compiling automates the install of bundler, gosu, and rest-client gems.
